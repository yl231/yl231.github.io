  This paper identifies critical limitations in current LLM routing evaluation and proposes a novel evaluation framework. Key contributions:
  - Identifies three major limitations: limited task diversity, imbalanced model pools, and oversimplified evaluation methodologies
  - Proposes a novel evaluation framework with diverse task distributions and balanced model pools
  - Implements an open-source benchmark with multi-faceted metrics for real-world deployment scenarios
  - **Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 LLM Evaluation Workshop**
  - Currently under review for ICLR 2026
