Hello! I am Yifan Lu, a final-year undergraduate student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Xia Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). My research interest is to build reliable, efficient, and interpretable AI systems, mostly LLMs.

<span style="color: red; font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>I am actively looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025</strong></span>
