I am Yifan (Louie) Lu, a first-year PhD student at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Xia Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). I completed my Bachelor's degree at Rice University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Hu. My research interests focus on multi-agent collaboration and the efficiency challenges associated with it. My current research direction centers on building next-generation LLM/Agent routing systems. 

Due to Prof. Hu's recent leave from Rice, I will be primarily working with Prof. [Jiarong Xing](https://jxing.me/) this academic year. Meanwhile, I am actively seeking PhD position for Fall 26 outside of Rice University.
